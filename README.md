# MCMC methods for sampling triangulations of manifolds

This repository contains supplementary material for article 

Sampling triangulations of manifolds using Monte Carlo methods by Eduardo Altmann and Jonathan Spreer.

In more detail, it contains a minimal working example of our MCMC method in dimensions 2 and 3 (Algorithm 1 and 2) to search through the space of all triangulations of (generalised triangulations of) surfaces and/or (1-vertex triangulations of) 3-manifolds. Both algorithms are presented in the form of a jupyter-notebook.
